### Hi!

My name is Silvia D'Angelo and I'm a Post Doc at University College Dublin, working with [Prof. Lorraine Brennan](https://people.ucd.ie/lorraine.brennan) and [Prof. Claire Gormley](https://maths.ucd.ie/people/gormley_c) on the ERC funded project A-DIET. Previoulsy I've been a PhD student in Statistics at Sapienza, University of Rome, under the supervision of [Prof. Marco Alfò](http://www.dss.uniroma1.it/it/dipartimento/alf-marco).
