Latent Space Models for Multivariate Networks ( [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spaceNet/index.html) )


R package for latent space models for multivariate networks. The model is defined within a Bayesian hierarchical framework, where it is assumed that the probability of observing an arc between any two nodes is inversely related to their distance in a low-dimensional latent space. Inference is carried out via MCMC algorithm.
